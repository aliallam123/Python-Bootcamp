### Python Numbers
You can check if a number is even or odd by simply dividing it by 2.
If the output is 0, the number is even. If the output is not 0, the number is odd.

Example:
56 % 2
0

###Indexing and Slicing with Strings
Indexing:
mystring = "Hello World"
mystring[2] = 'l'
mystring[-3] = 'r'

Slicing:
mystring = 'abcdefghijk'
mystring[3:6] = 'def'

The strings start at 0.
0 = a, 1 = b, 2 = c etc.

mystring[::2] = jumps in 2s. So the output would be 'acegik'

mystring[::-1] reverses the string
output = 'kjihgfedcba'

###Print Formatting with Strings
Float formatting follows "{value:width.precision f}"

result = 100/77
result
output = 0,1287...

print("The result was {r:1.2f}".format(r=result))

output = The result was 104.12

to output something on one line you can write:
print('{}'.format('Python rules!'))
