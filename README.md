# Python-Bootcamp
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Python Bootcamp repo! This is where Iâ€™ll be sharing everything I learn as I dive into a Python bootcamp course on Udemy. Expect to see this space constantly evolving as I pick up new skills, write more code, and experiment with different projects.

What Youâ€™ll Find Here
Notes: My personal takeaways and explanations of the topics covered.
Code Samples: Some cool (and maybe not-so-cool) code I write as I practice.
Exercises: The practice problems I work on, with my solutions (or attempts, at least).
Mini-Projects: Small projects I build to put my learning into action.
Follow Along!
Iâ€™ll be updating this repo regularly, so feel free to follow along, drop any suggestions, or just see how my Python journey unfolds!
